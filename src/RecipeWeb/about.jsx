        <p>was an American
                writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his
                poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the
                macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in
                the United States and of American literature as a whole, and he was
                one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. He
                is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre
                and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of
                science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to earn
                a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult
                life and career.
            Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and
            Elizabeth "Eliza" Arnold HopkHis father
            abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following
            year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances
            Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he
            was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as
            John Allan and Edgar Poe repeatedly clashed over debts, including
            those incurred by gambling, and the cost of Poe's secondary
            education. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a
            year due to lack of money. Edgar Poe quarreled with John Allan over
            the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under
            an assumed nam(this has been
            debunked, see)
